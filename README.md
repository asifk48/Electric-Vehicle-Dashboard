<h2>ðŸš€ Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    This project features a comprehensive <strong>Tableau Dashboard</strong> analyzing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The dashboard provides insights into EV types, geographic distribution, affordability, and utility services, enabling stakeholders to understand the EV ecosystem better.
</p>
<p>
    The analysis is based on a dataset containing over <strong>150,000 electric vehicle records</strong> with details such as vehicle type, range, price, location, and eligibility for clean energy incentives.
</p>

<h2>ðŸ”„ Data Pipeline</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Dataset Preprocessing</strong>:<br>
        Data was cleaned and processed in Excel to handle missing values, validate data consistency, and optimize structure for Tableau. Example adjustments include formatting <code>Electric Range</code>, <code>Base MSRP</code>, and geographic columns (<code>County</code>, <code>City</code>, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tableau Integration</strong>:<br>
        Data was imported into Tableau for visualization design. Dashboards were created to reflect key trends and insights interactively.
